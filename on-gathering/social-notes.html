        <!--
            What would you like to gather?
            
            Determine the topic for your crowd-sourced collection.
            Determine your method for aggregating content.
            How many entries would you like?
            Is it for an organization?
            Is it media-specific? (e.g. written quotes, hand-drawn portraits, PDFs, etc)
            Is there a time period?
            Does it fill a void?

            <li>Door holding device, design workshop: Participants folow my instructions (taken from a kind of <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/5-stages-in-the-design-thinking-process">stages of design thinking handbook</a>). The event begins with material decision, sketching, selling.</li>
            <li>Scavenger hunt competition: each participant is allotted 20 minutes to wonder outside and find a photo for the collection. The photos are then exhibitied on a website.</li>
            <li>I chose this idea becuase it requires a cleverness and quick improvizational thinking, and therefore the results are nimble and interresting. What if I created a set of design problems for people to solve quickly. There could be a timer and a submission method.</li>
