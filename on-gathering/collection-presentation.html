This platform is an experiment in broadcasting and community building which allows different corners of the art world to interact with each other in person and on air—a place where media finally meets flesh. Offering space and time to both the established and emerging or underrepresented, we are drawn to art that exists in the unexpected, the authenticity of sharing without a script, the sounds of ideas in the making, conversation that forgets there’s an audience. We strive to question current knowledge economies while doing our best to interrupt commercial means of communication. All of our in-studio broadcasts are free and open to the public."</span>
