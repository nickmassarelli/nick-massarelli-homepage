	<div id="information">A platform for sharing our books. At the start of each semester an email will be sent out to the graphic design program asking for five or more book contributions from each student. Each book on this website is available for borrowing from its owner, for a two week duration. The website also acts as a gallery of our collective interests. Books can be added to this website at any time through the Area.na channel by clicking the Submit button below. Use the library card to label your books and record their journey.
	During the first week of the semester, we will gather in the atrium for a book swap. Each contributor is asked to bring their five books for sharing. This event will be an opportunity for us to get together, and share our collections.
